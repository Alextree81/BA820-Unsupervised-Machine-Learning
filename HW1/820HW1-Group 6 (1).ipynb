    "### [Problem 1] Basic Text Analysis [45 pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem involves a mix of Python review (loops, conditionals, counters/dictionaries, sorting) and learning to work with a sizable collection of text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be looking at a phenomenon of \"natural languages\" (i.e., human languages, such as English) called *Zipf's law*, which relates how frequently a word occurs in a language to its \"rank\" (the word with rank 1 is the most frequently occurring word, the word with rank 2 is the second most frequently occurring word, etc). Roughly speaking, the word with rank 1 appears twice as likely as the word with rank 2, and the three times as likely as the word with rank 3, and so forth. (Some details on Zipf's law can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law).) In this problem, you are going to check whether Zipf's law holds for a real dataset of text documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we look at is a collection of the 100 most popular books downloaded from the [Gutenburg Project](https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top). These 100 books form the corpus that we consider for this problem. Each file contains the text of a book. We will read in all 100 books.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Please *do not* change the folder name or the path, and make sure you use a relative path (e.g. './HW1_Dataset/*filename*) when reading the files. When grading your homework, we will put your Jupyter notebook file and the dataset in the same folder, and run your code. **You will not receive points for this problem if your code fails to load the data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: To list all files that match a certain pattern, you can use the `glob` package. Here's an example usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import glob\n",
    "print(glob.glob('./HW1_Dataset/*.txt'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a) Warm-up/basic Python review [15 pts across subparts].** This part serves as a warm-up, getting you familiar with the kind of code we will be writing in this class. Note that throughout part (a), your code should **not** be using spaCy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subpart i [5 pts].** Write a loop that iterates through all 100 books; for each book, print out its corresponding file name and also how long the book is in terms of string length (meaning that if we load in the book as a string, we compute the length of the string using the built-in Python function `len`; this is just counting the number of characters).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please do not actually print out the contents of each book since many of the books are extremely long, and by printing out all the books' contents, you'll end up creating a Jupyter notebook that has a massive file size.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: When debugging your code, you may want to first make sure your code runs on a few of the books rather than all 100 (for example, you can start by only having 3 of the text files in `HW1_Dataset`). Once you're confident that your solution is correct on a few text files, then run on all of them! This is a standard approach to debugging code that is meant to handle large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your output should look like (although there should be 100 books rather than 3 as shown below; also, the ordering of the books might be different on your machine):\n",
